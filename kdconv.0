NAME
     kdconv -- PDF optimizer for Kindle2/3/Sony Reader.

SYNOPSIS
     kdconv [-a author] [-bce] [-f deviceformat] [-o] [-p devicedoc] [-tv]
	    input-pdf output-pdf

DESCRIPTION
     kdconv is a program for converting a PDF document into a Kindle and/or
     Sony Reader(PRS-350) friendly format.

     It converts input-pdf file and outputs as output-pdf.  Some devices use
     output-pdf filename with eliminating `.pdf' suffix as the title name of
     the book, so you should aware of the behavior.

     If pdftk(1) is installed in your environment, this program tries to embed
     output-pdf file name as title meta data into the PDF with eliminating
     `.pdf' suffix.

OPTIONS
     -a AUTHOR
	     Set PDF's creator.  Kindle uses this value as an author.  This
	     option is available if pdftk(1) is installed.

     -b      Output as bi-level(1-bit monochrome) format.  It might be useful
	     if you'd like to process bi-level format input-pdf.

     -c      After PDF convert is finished, the converted file will be trans-
	     ferred into Kindle documents directory.  You have to connect Kin-
	     dle into your Mac beforehand.  If Kindle is not connected, do
	     nothing with showing warning.  If output-pdf contains directory
	     name, this options uses the filename part of it only.

     -e      After copy is finished, this program tries to eject Kindle auto-
	     matically.  Without -c option, this option has no effect.

     -f      Set target device.  Possible values are ``kindle'', ``kindledx''
	     and ``sonyreader''.  Default value is ``kindle''.

     -o      In spite of already existing output-pdf file, this option allows
	     to overwrite it.  If you do not specify this option, and if a
	     file which has same name already exists, this program stops with
	     error messages.

     -p      Set path for `documents' directory of Kindle or `READER' direc-
	     tory for Sony Reader.  Default value is decided from -f option
	     value.

     -t      Tries to eliminate extra space around the input-pdf.  Trimmed
	     area will be decided based on corner pixels color.

     -v      Show version.

EXAMPLES
     Convert ``foo.pdf'' to ``bar.pdf'' for Kindle2/3:

	   $ kdconv foo.pdf bar.pdf

     Convert ``sample.pdf'' to ``My document.pdf'' and copy it to Kindle auto-
     matically, then eject Kindle:

	   $ kdconv -c -e sample.pdf My\ document.pdf

     Convert ``1.pdf'' to ``out.pdf'' with trimming extra space, and allow to
     overwrite it if ``out.pdf'' already exists:

	   $ kdconv -t -o 1.pdf out.pdf

BUGS
     Please report bugs to below AUTHOR section's address.

     If an original PDF is created with vector format data, generated file's
     view area will be reduced than original one, or not easy-to read file.

     It's fairly infrequently occurred, but converting might not be finished
     with wrong run of ImageMagick's convert command.  Please stop to covert
     and retry it.

SPECIAL THANKS
     I appreciate follow people who contribute useful information and/or patch
     for enhancing script.
